Lab Overview
============

Day 3, you get a little curious and wonder why both BIG-IP’s you’ve been
working on say they’re managed by BIG-IQ (look near the red f5 ball on
the top left of both BIG-IP’s). Unbelievable, all this time you’ve been
configuring both devices independently when you could have been
configuring them on a central management device.

Central Management Version - 6.0 was a major evolution of the BIG-IQ
product line designed to become the primary source of centralized
management for all physical and virtual F5 BIG-IP devices. BIG-IQ
extends its offerings for security users, improving the user experience,
and adding robustness and scale throughout the platform. 

Base BIG-IQ Configuration
-------------------------

In this lab, the VE has been configured with the basic system settings
and the VLAN/self-IP configurations required for the BIG-IQ to
communicate and pass traffic on the network. Additionally, the Data
Collection Device has already been added to BIG-IQ and the BIG-IP’s have
been imported and have been gathering health statistics. They have not
however had their configurations imported.

New features
------------

**STATISTICS DASHBOARDS –**

This is the real first step managing data statistics using a DCD (data
collection device) evolving toward a true analytics platform. In this
guide, we will explore setting up and establishing connectivity using
master key to each DCD (data collection device).

-  Enabling statistics for each functional area as part of the discovery
   process. This will allow BIG-IQ to proxy statistics gathered and
   organized from each BIG-IP device leveraging F5 Analytics iApp
   service (https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/f5-analytics-iapp).

-  Configuration and tuning of statistic collections post discovery
   allowing the user to focus on data specific to their needs.

-  Viewing and interaction with statistics dashboard, such as filtering
   views, differing time spans, selection and drilldown into dashboards
   for granular data trends and setting a refresh interval for
   collections.

**Auto-scaling in a VMware cloud environment**

You can now securely manage traffic to applications in a VMware cloud
environment, specifying the parameters in a service scaling group to
dynamically deploy and delete BIG-IP devices as needed. BIG-IQ manages
the BIG-IP devices that are load balancing to the BIG-IP VE devices in
the cloud, as well as to the BIG-IP devices' application servers.

**Auto-scaling in an AWS environment**

You can now securely manage traffic to applications in a VMware cloud
environment, specifying the parameters in a service scaling group to
