Lab Overview
============

During this lab, you will configure the BIG-IP system to detect and
report on various network level Denial of Service events. You will then
run simulated attacks against the BIG-IP and verify the mitigation,
reporting and logging of these attacks.

Base BIG-IP Configuration
=========================

In this lab, the VE has been configured with the basic system settings
and the VLAN/self-IP configurations required for the BIG-IP to
communicate and pass traffic on the network. We will now need to
configure the BIG-IP to listen for traffic and pass it to the back-end
server.
